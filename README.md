### Implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm in Python 3

Challenge: The only resource is this Wikipedia Article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
Using this Video also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE


### Goal: 

Web based GUI where one can draw a obstacle and the program finds the quickest path around it to a predetermined target

(+extra nice visualsation)

### ToDo:

* implement command line solution 
* Change x and y axis 


### How does A* work?

A* selects the path that minimizes

    f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

n is the next node on the path
g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n
h(n) is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal 
A* terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended

The heuristic function is usually implemented using a priority queue (Binary heap)

### My (bad) implementation 

Map = 2d array of bits
0 = free
1 = cant go through

object oriented implementation:

Class Node (n): 
    fields: 
        g: g cost of n, distance to start n
        h: h cost of n, distance to end n
        f: g+h
